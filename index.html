                <p class="author">by NF</p>
                <div class="text">
                    <a>Yeah, I'm on my way, I'm coming<br>
                        Don't, don't lose faith in me<br>
                        I know you've been waitin'<br>
                        I know you've been prayin' for my soul<br>
                        Hope, hope</a>

                    <a>Thirty years you been draggin' your feet<br>
                        Tellin' me I'm the reason we're stagnant<br>
                        Thirty years you've been claiming you're honest<br>
                        And promising progress, well, where's it at?<br>
                        I don't want you to feel like a failure <em>(failure)</em><br>
                        I know this hurts<br>
                        But I gave you your chance to deliver <em>(deliver)</em><br>
                        Now it's my turn<br>
                        Don't get me wrong, Nate, you've had a great run<br>
                        But it's time to give the people somethin' different<br>
                        So without further ado, I'd<br>
                        Like to introduce my<br>
                        <em>(My album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album, my album)</em><br>
                        Hope<br>
                        What's my definition of success? <em>(Of success)</em><br>
                        Listening to what your heart says <em>(your heart says)</em><br>
                        Standing up for what you know is <em>(is)</em><br>
                        Right, while everybody else is <em>(is)</em><br>
                        Tucking their tail between their legs <em>(okay)</em><br>
                        What's my definition of success? <em>(Of success)</em><br>
                        Creating something no one else can <em>(else can)</em><br>
                        Being brave enough to dream big <em>(big)</em><br>
                        Grindin' when you're told to just quit <em>(quit)</em><br>
                        Giving more when you got nothin' left <em>(left)</em><br>
                        It's a person that'll take a chance on<br>
                        Something they were told could never happen<br>
                        It's a person that can see the bright side through the dark times when there ain't one<br>
                        It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'<br>
                        Ain't afraid to walk away from more profit<br>
                        'Cause they'd rather do somethin' that they really love and take the pay cut<br>
                        It's a person that would never waver<br>
                        Or change who they are<br>
                        Just to try and gain some credibility<br>
                        So they could feel accepted by a stranger<br>
                        It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation<br>
                        It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazing</a>
                    <a>What a little bit of faith can do if you don't even believe in you<br>
                        Why would you think or expect anybody else that's around you to?<br>
                        I done did things that I regret<br>
                        I done said things I can't take back<br>
                        Was a lost soul at a crossroad who had no hope but I changed that<br>
                        I spent years of my life holdin' on to things I never should've kept, full of hatred<br>
                        Years of my life carryin' a lot of baggage that I should've walked away from<br>
                        Years of my life wishin' I was someone different, lookin' for some validation<br>
                        Years of my life tryna fill the void, pretending I was in<br>
                        They get it</a>

                    <a>Growing pain's a necessary evil<br>
                        Difficult to go through, yes, but beneficial<br>
                        Some would say having a mental breakdown is a negative thing<br>
                        Which on one hand, I agree with<br>
                        On the other hand, it was the push I needed<br>
                        To get help and start the healing process, see<br>
                        If I'd have never hit rock bottom<br>
                        Would I be the person that I am today?<br>
                        I don't believe so<br>
                        I'm a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons<br>
                        Took me thirty years to realize that if you want to get the opportunity<br>
                        To be the greatest version of yourself<br>
                        Sometimes you got to be someone you're not to hear the voice of reason<br>
                        Having kids will make you really take a step back and look in the mirror<br>
                        At least for me that's what it did, I</a>
                    <a>Wake up every day and pick my son up, hold him in my arms<br>
                        And let him know he's loved (loved)<br>
                        Standing by the window questioning if dad is ever going to show up (up)<br>
                        Isn't something he's gon' have to worry about<br>
                        Don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot<br>
                        Mama, I forgive you<br>
                        I just don't want him to grow up thinkin' that he'll never be enough<br>

                        Thirty years of never, thirty years of maybe<br>
                        Thirty years of later, thirty years of fake<br>
                        Thirty years of hollow, thirty years of sorrow<br>
                        Thirty years of darkness, thirty years of <em>(Nate)</em><br>

                        Thirty years of torment, thirty years of <em>(wait)</em><br>
                        Thirty years of bitter, thirty years of lonely<br>
                        Thirty years of pushing everyone away<br>
                        <em>(You'll never evolve)</em> I know I can change<br>
                        (We are not enough) we are not the same<br>
                        <em>(You don't have the heart)</em> you don't have the strength<br>
                        <em>(You don't have the will)</em> you don't have the faith<br>
                        <em>(You'll never be loved, you'll never be safe<br>
                        Might as well give up)</em> not running away<br>
                        <em>(You don't have the guts)</em> you're the one afraid<br>
                        I'm the one in charge<br>
                        I'm taking the <em>(no)</em><br>
